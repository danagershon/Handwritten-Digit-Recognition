# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
Numerical Algorithms Winter 2022-2023 HW3: Handwritten Digit Recognition in MATLAB using Least Squares

• Program is Given a training set containing thousands of handwritten digits and their actual classification

• Program solves the Least Square Problem for the training set

• Using the LS solution, the program tries to classify the digits in the training and test set 

• Full Accuracy results analysis reported in the PDF file

• Dataset containing the handwritten digits images (mnist.mat )could not be uploaded because it is over 25 Mb (even compressed)
